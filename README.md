Titanic Survival Prediction and Analysis![image](https://github.com/Saeedafrough/Titanic/assets/144301639/f2f02dbc-f814-4607-8ec6-fda734e119c3)
we explore the tragic sinking of the Titanic in 1912, aiming to answer one critical question: What were the factors that determined who survived and who did not?



The Titanic disaster claimed the lives of more than 1,500 passengers and crew members, making it one of the deadliest maritime tragedies in history.

The Titanic Dataset is a dataset curated on the basis of the passengers on titanic, like their age, class, gender, etc.. to predict if they would have survived or not. 

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

Building a predictive model to analyze whether a random passenger will survive based on their age, gender, cabin, Fare, and more. First, we will visualize data and then, based on it, adjust the parameter values according to our requirements![image](https://github.com/Saeedafrough/Titanic/assets/144301639/f5a26bd1-b7a5-413e-aa1d-cb9c6a17df14)

Objectives :

1 - Survival Prediction: Build a strong classification model to predict whether the passenger survives or not.

2 - Insight Discovery: To uncover meaningful insights and patterns within the Titanic dataset, shedding light on the factors that influenced passenger survival. 

3 - compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.
